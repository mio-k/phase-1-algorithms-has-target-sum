  Add your pseudocode here
Starting from the first item of the array and loop through the whole array(i),
also start another loop from the next number in the array(j),
add the two number with each iteration, and compare it against the target value.
if they match, push "true" to the result array.
after looping through all elements of the array, check if the result array includes the value true.  If yes, return true, if no, return false.

/*
Add written explanation of your solution here
take one number from the array
add it with the first number in the array 
compare the resulting value against the target value
if they are the same, return true.
then move on to the second number in the array to do the same.
repeat until you get to the last number of the array.
meanwhile, whenver you get true, store it in an array.
After going through all the numbers, check the array.
if it's empty the final result is false.
